<!--how to make an image turn into a link-->

<!DOCTYPE html>  <!--To tell browser which html version you are using-->
<html> <!--All html structure and content goes inside html tag-->
  <head> <!--info about the page that is not displayed directly on the page-->
    <title>Teacup Poodle</title> <!--this will show as the tab heading-->
  </head>
  <body> 
  <a href="https://www.perfectdogbreeds.com/teacup-poodle/" target="_blank"><img src="teacup.jpg" alt="A small furry dog that fits in a teacup"/></a>
<!--links to a webpage are done using the anchor element. The href is used to tell which webpage is to be linked.
the target="blank" tells us that it needs to be opened in a different tab.

Save the image in the same file as this html file. If it is saved as "teacup.jpg" in the file then write the 
same name in the src of the image.
Thus, the image is turned into a link because the image is wrapped inside the anchor element.-->
<!--Now when you click the picture it will take you to a different page in a different tab.-->
